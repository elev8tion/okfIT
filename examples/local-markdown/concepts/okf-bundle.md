# OKF Bundle Structure

An Open Knowledge Format bundle is a directory of Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

Minimum valid concept:

```md
---
type: Concept
---

# Concept title
```

Useful generated fields include `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, and `timestamp`.

okfit keeps output file-based so humans can inspect it, Git can diff it, and MCP clients can read only the concepts they need.
