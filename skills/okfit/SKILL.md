# okfIT

## Overview

Use okfIT to turn documentation websites or local Markdown folders into local Open Knowledge Format bundles, then expose them to agents through a read-only MCP server. Prefer `npx -y okfit` in generated commands so clients can launch the published package without a global install.

## Quick Reference

| Goal                                 | Command or action                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Register a docs site and print setup | `npx -y okfit init <name> <url> --client codex --max-pages 100 --max-depth 4`                 |
| Import local Markdown                | `npx -y okfit import ./docs --out ./docs-okf --source-name "Project docs"`                    |
| Prove a source for a task            | `npx -y okfit activate <name-or-bundle> --client codex --task "<task>" --out okfit-activation` |
| Preview readiness and graph          | `npx -y okfit map <name-or-bundle> --out okfit-inspector.html`                                 |
| Diagnose setup                       | `npx -y okfit doctor <name> --client codex`                                                   |
| Serve to MCP                         | `npx -y okfit serve <name-or-bundle> --mcp --auto-refresh`                                    |

## Setup Workflow

1. Choose a short source name such as `stripe`, `clerk`, or `project-docs`.
2. For a docs website, run `npx -y okfit init <name> <url> --client codex --max-pages 100 --max-depth 4`.
3. For local Markdown, run `import`, then `validate`, then serve the generated bundle path. Only add `--force` after the user explicitly approves overwriting the output directory.
4. When the user wants proof before config changes, run `activate` with `--task` matching their real question. The packet includes `okfit-inspector.html`, `okfit-setup.md`, and `okfit-proof.json`.
5. If setup fails or the MCP client cannot see tools, run `doctor` before editing client config by hand.

## MCP Use

When an okfIT MCP server is available, use the tools in this order:

1. `bundle_summary` to inspect validation status, freshness, available sources, and tool expectations.
2. `search_concepts` with the user's task terms. Use `source` filters in multi-source workspaces when the relevant docs source is known.
3. `read_concept` for the most relevant concepts, keeping reads small before expanding.
4. `get_neighbors` when the answer depends on linked concepts, backlinks, prerequisites, or nearby API/reference pages.
5. Cite the source URLs or resource fields surfaced by the concept results.

Start with narrow searches, then broaden only when results are thin. In workspaces, pass both `source` and `id` to `read_concept` when concept ids are ambiguous.

## Workspaces

Serve multiple registered sources through one MCP server when a task spans a stack:

```bash
npx -y okfit serve stripe clerk --mcp --auto-refresh
```

Then filter searches:

```json
{ "query": "checkout sessions", "source": "stripe", "limit": 5 }
```

Use `source` filters whenever the user names the product, API, framework, or docs source. If the user asks across the stack, search the workspace without a filter first, then use per-source reads for precision.

## Safety Rules

- MCP tools are read-only. Auto-refresh is server-side maintenance for registered sources, not an agent-callable write tool.
- Do not use `npx okfit`; use `npx -y okfit` for no-install commands.
- Do not run `serve --mcp` as a normal chatty terminal session. MCP clients launch it as a stdio subprocess.
- Do not bypass crawler safety defaults, private-network protections, or unsafe `--force` guards unless the user explicitly accepts the risk.
- Do not hand-edit client config first when `init`, `activate`, or `doctor` can produce or verify the exact command/config.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                            | Fix                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Treating okfIT like a hosted index  | Keep the workflow local: bundle files, MCP stdio, and source URLs remain inspectable. |
| Reading every concept after search | Read the top matches first, then use neighbors to expand only where needed.           |
| Ignoring workspace source names    | Use `source` filters and source-qualified reads for multi-source bundles.             |
| Skipping proof                     | Use `activate --task` when the user needs confidence before wiring MCP.               |
| Debugging config blindly           | Run `doctor <name> --client codex` and follow its next repair command.                |
